PHP file permissions-
    >File permissions specify what you can do with a particular file in the system e.g., reading, writing or executing the file.

PHP checking file permissions-
    >is_readable() returns true if you are allowed to read the file, otherwise returns false.
    >is_writable() returns true if you are allowed to write the file, otherwise returns false.
    >is_executable() returns true if you are allowed to execute the file, otherwise returns false.
    >fileperms() function that returns an integer, which represents the permissions that are set on a particular file.

PHP changing file permissions-

    >To change the file permissions, or mode, you use chmod() function.
    >Syntax-
        chmod ( string $filename , int $mode ) : bool[Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.]
    >Note that mode is not automatically assumed to be an octal value, so to ensure the expected operation, you need to prefix mode with a zero (0).
    >modes - read = 4, write = 2, execute =1

File Handling

    Open file-
        >fopen() function is used to open a file.
            Syntax-
                > fopen ( string $filename , string $mode [, bool $use_include_path = false [, resource $context ]] )            
            >Returns a file pointer resource on success, or FALSE on failure.
            Modes-
                'r' - Open for reading only; place the file pointer at the beginning of the file.
                'r+' - Open for reading and writing; place the file pointer at the beginning of the file.
                'w' - Open for writing only; place the file pointer at the beginning of the file and truncate the file to zero length. If the file does not exist, attempt to create it.
                'w+' - Open for reading and writing; place the file pointer at the beginning of the file and truncate the file to zero length. If the file does not exist, attempt to create it. 
    Close file-
        >fclose() - Closes an open file pointer
        Syntax-
            fclose ( resource $handle ) : bool
        >Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

    Deletes file-
        >unlink() - To delete a file
        Syntax-
            unlink ( string $filename [, resource $context ] ) : bool
        > Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.
