            MySQL database server.
    >Driver-
        -A driver is a piece of software designed to communicate with a specific type of database server.
            The driver may also call a library, such as the MySQL Client Library or the MySQL Native Driver.
            These libraries implement the low-level protocol used to communicate with the MySQL database server.
    
    >Extension-
