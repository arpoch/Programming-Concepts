Cookies - These are text files stored on the client computer and they are kept of use tracking purpose.

There are three steps involved in identifying returning users âˆ’

    Server script sends a set of cookies to the browser.
        For example name, age, or identification number etc.

    Browser stores this information on local machine for future use.

    When next time browser sends any request to web server then it sends those cookies 
        information to the server and server uses that information to identify the user.

Setting Cookies with PHP-
    setcookie()-
        function to set a cookie.
        This function requires upto seven arguments and should be called before <html> tag.
        For each cookie this function has to be called separately.
    syntax- 
        setcookie(name, value, expire, path, domain, security);            
            Arguments-
                >name - The name of the cookie.
                >value- The value of the cookie. 
                        This value is stored on the clients computer; do not store sensitive information.
                >expires- The time the cookie expires.
                           This is a Unix timestamp so is in number of seconds since the epoch.
                           example - time()+(7*24*60*60) [1 week]
                >path- The path on the server in which the cookie will be available on. 
                        If set to '/', the cookie will be available within the entire domain.
                > domain- The (sub)domain that the cookie is available to. 
                > secure- Indicates that the cookie should only be transmitted over a secure HTTPS connection from the client.
                            When set to TRUE, the cookie will only be set if a secure connection exists. 
                > httponly- When TRUE the cookie will be made accessible only through the HTTP protocol.
                             This means that the cookie won't be accessible by scripting languages, such as JavaScript.

    Return Value-
        If setcookie() successfully runs, it will return TRUE,setcookie() will fail and return FALSE.

Accessing Cookies- PHP provides many ways to access cookies. Simplest way is to use either $_COOKIE or $HTTP_COOKIE_VARS variables.
    syntax-
        $_COOKIE["string name..."]

Deleting Cookie - set the cookie with a date that has already expired such as time()-60;
